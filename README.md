# MRM_2025_dBdt_over_Efield_ratios
Simulated data published in MRM article "Simulation of dB/dt-over-electric field cardiac magnetostimulation safety ratios in 75 body models and 18 gradient systems" by V. Klein, J. Edmonson, M. Davids, N. Ferris, M. Gebhardt, D. Rattenbacher, J. van den Brink, M. Steckner, L. Wald, B. Guerin (2025). The Excel spreadsheet contains dB/dt-over-Emax, dB/d-over-E99.9, and dB/dt-over-E99 ratios simulated in study #1 and study #2 for all body models, gradient systems (GC#1-#13), and axis combinations (X, Y, Z, X+Y+Z) in units of (T/s)/(V/m).
